The Royal Enfield Hunter 350 is the brand’s most accessible motorcycle, and is also the most affordable Royal Enfield bike based on the J platform. 

Royal Enfield Hunter 350 Price:

The Royal Enfield Hunter 350 is offered in three variants: Factory (Black & Silver), Dapper (Grey, Ash & White) and Rebel (Red, Black & Blue). The Factory variant is priced at Rs 1,49,900 and the mid-spec Dapper variant comes at Rs 1,66,900. The top-end Rebel models will cost you Rs 1,71,900 (prices are ex-showroom Delhi). 

Royal Enfield Hunter 350 Features:

Royal Enfield has equipped the Hunter 350 with a retro-style semi-analogue instrument cluster, with Tripper navigation system being provided as an optional extra. While the base Factory variant comes with a small digital inset with odometer, fuel gauge, trip meter (A&B) and maintenance indicator, the mid-spec and high-end variants get a larger, more info-packed digital inset with gear position indicator and clock, just like the one on the Royal Enfield Meteor 350. It even features retro-looking rotary switch cubes on either switchgear, and a left switch cube-mounted USB port (on the mid-spec and higher-end variants). On the other hand the base variant gets conventional switchgear sans USB port.

Royal Enfield Hunter 350 Engine:

Hunter 350 is powered by the same 349cc air-cooled engine which is present in both RE Classic 350 and Meteor 350. The mill churns out a peak power of 20.2PS and 27Nm of peak torque and is paired with a five-speed gearbox. The bike comes with a 13-litre fuel tank and has a tested mileage of 40.19kmpl in the city and 35.97kmpl on the highway.

Royal Enfield Hunter 350 Suspension & Brakes:

The Hunter is equipped with a telescopic fork along with a dual shock absorber. Adding to its sportiness are the 17-inch alloy wheels that come wrapped in tubeless tyres. For braking, the motorcycle makes use of a 300mm disc up front and a 270mm unit at the rear with dual-channel ABS assist. The base variant rolls on spoke wheels, different, slimmer tyres, and a drum brake at the rear. The motorcycle weighs 181kg (kerb) and is the lightest Royal Enfield bike in India.

Royal Enfield Hunter 350 Rivals:

The Hunter 350 primarily competes with the Honda CB350RS and the Jawa 42 2.1. It might even rival the upcoming Bajaj-Triumph motorcycle given its price range.
