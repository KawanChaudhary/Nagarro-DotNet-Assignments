I have never pondered on such a question that reflects the whole human race and what it means to be a human being. What it means to be a human being is not just having a face, eyes, heart, or being able to drive a car, or to own a house. Being a human being is much more than that, deeper and more passionate.

The Chinese and Vietnamese may not know each other, but because of relationships that went on since the dawn of time, they both know what to say, what to do, and how to do it when they meet and talk. Because of relationships, we can know the traditions and customs of different people from different backgrounds.
